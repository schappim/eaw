My command line text editor of choice is `vi` or `vim` (vi improved), however if you're new to the command line a more accessible text editor is called `micro`. 

You can find [more about micro here](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro).

#### Installation

Micro is a relatively new text editor and you won't be able to install it via `apt` yet. In contrast `vi` was first released in 1976!

To install the micro run the following: 

```curl https://getmic.ro | bash```

#### Commands

The commands for `micro` are similar to the default Windows keybaord shortcuts with: 

- `ctl+s` to __save__
- `ctl+q` to __quit__
- `ctl+o` to __open__
- `ctl+z` to __undo__

I'll be using `micro` on the command line because command line text editors are easier to capture using [asciinema](asciinema.org) (the tool I'm using for capturing the command line).
